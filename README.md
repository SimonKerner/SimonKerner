### Hey!

My name is Simon and I am a computer science student from Germany. I am currently in my Master's program and my major is Data Science. I started programming about 5+ years ago in my first semester and since then I have been very eager to learn and explore new technologies. Aritifcial Intelligence and probabilistic programming is an area I'm focusing on right now.
